<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Sandhya, a second-year Computer Science student at Atria Institute of Technology in Bengaluru. 
  My journey in the tech world began with a fascination for how things work behind the scenes on the web. 
  This curiosity has driven me to delve deeply into web development, where I enjoy creating dynamic and responsive 
  websites that provide users with seamless experiences.</p>

  From designing algorithms to developing software applications, I find immense satisfaction in the creative and logical 
  processes involved. Each new project I undertake is an opportunity to learn, innovate, and push the boundaries of 
  what I can achieve.</p>

<p>In addition to web development and programming, I am also deeply interested in cybersecurity. 
  In today's digital age, the importance of securing data and protecting systems cannot be overstated. 
  I am committed to understanding the complexities of cyber threats and developing strategies to safeguard information. 
  With a solid foundation in these areas, I aspire to contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape and make a positive
   impact through my skills and knowledge.
